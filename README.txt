I've decided to aim for the VG grade by method of one small feature and one medium feature. 

Features of my game that are not on the list are in brackets. VG features have their respective sizes included for convenience.

General

* a play scene
* main menu and game over scene (VG, small)

Turn based game

* two players with the same keyboard

Terrain

* basic terrain features
(Hoops. Cannot forget the hoops.) 

Players

* one character per player
* hit points (+ style points)
* custom character controller allowing "hot seat" controls
(* time limited turns for the players)

Camera

* camera focuses on active player

Weapon

* firing and aiming
* weapons have ammo/turn (VG, small)
* health and weapon pickups (VG, medium)
